# DeepLearning

A project written in C++ that implements basic operations such as backpropagation and forms of cross-validation. There is also more advanced second-order gradient descent methods which takes into account the Hessian matrix for training (such as DFP which is implemented here). 

All vector operations and backpropagation operations are self-implemented using only tools in the C++ STL. There is no dependencies in this project.
